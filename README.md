# Feed Reader Testing

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The case is writing test suites according to given expectations.

## Expectations
1. Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
3. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
4. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. 
7. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
8. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
9. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
10. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
11. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
